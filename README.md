# FRAUD-DETECTION
ML project to detect fraudulent transactions using EDA, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project involves identifying fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.  
I used a dataset with 6 million+ records and built models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Project Steps
- Data Cleaning and Understanding
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building and Evaluation
- Feature Importance & ROC Curve
- Final Model: Random Forest

## Best Model Performance
- Precision (Fraud): 98%
- Recall (Fraud): 79%
- F1-Score: 87%

## Tools Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Files Included
- fraud_detection.ipynb
- README.md
